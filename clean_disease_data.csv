rectal ear tympanic and forehead temporal artery thermometers oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature ear or forehead thermometers although convenient provide less accurate temperature measurements in infants a rectal temperature if doable is somewhat more accurate when reporting a temperature to your health care provider give both the reading and the type of thermometer used when to see a doctorfevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm or a reason to call a doctor yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby your child or yourself infants and toddlers a fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers call your babys health care provider if your child is younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 1004 f 38 c or higher between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 f 389 c or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable sluggish or uncomfortable between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 f 389 c that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms if your child also has other signs and symptoms such as a runny nose cough or diarrhea you can call sooner children theres probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive this means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice your child may also be drinking fluids and playing call your childs health care provider if your child is

this balance even when youre healthy your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day it can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening when your immune system responds to disease the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher this prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss the shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat when you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled you are helping your body retain heat fevers below 104 f 40 c associated with common viral infections such as the flu may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by a viral infection a bacterial infection heat exhaustion certain inflammatory

5,description,lung cancer typically doesnt cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages signs and symptoms of lung cancer typically occur when the disease is advanced signs and symptoms of lung cancer may include a new cough that doesnt go away coughing up blood even a small amount shortness of breath chest pain hoarseness losing weight without trying bone pain headache when to see a doctormake an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you if you smoke and have been unable to quit make an appointment with your doctor your doctor can recommend strategies for quitting smoking such as counseling medications and nicotine replacement productsmore informationlung cancer care at mayo clinicbone scan,smoking causes the majority of lung cancers both in smokers and in people exposed to secondhand smoke but lung cancer also occurs in people who never smoked and in those who never had prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke in these cases there may be no clear cause of lung cancer how smoking causes lung cancerdoctors believe smoking causes lung cancer by damaging the cells that line the lungs when you inhale cigarette smoke which is full of cancercausing substances carcinogens changes in the lung tissue begin almost immediately at first your body may be able to repair this damage but with each repeated exposure normal cells that line your lungs are increasingly damaged over time the damage causes cells to act abnormally and eventually cancer may develop types of lung cancerdoctors divide lung cancer into two major types based on the appearance of lung cancer cells under the microscope your doctor makes treatment decisions based on which major type of lung cancer you have the two general types of lung cancer include small cell lung cancer small cell lung cancer occurs almost exclusively in heavy smokers and is less common than nonsmall cell lung cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer is an umbrella term for several types of lung cancers nonsmall cell lung cancers include squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma risk factorsa number of factors may increase your risk of lung cancer some risk factors can be controlled for instance by quitting smoking and other factors cant be controlled such as your family history risk factors for lung cancer include smoking your risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and the number of years you have smoked quitting at any age can significantly lower your risk of developing lung cancer exposure to secondhand smoke even if you dont smoke your risk of lung cancer increases if youre exposed to secondhand smoke previous radiation therapy if youve undergone radiation therapy to the chest for another type of cancer you may have an increased risk of developing lung cancer exposure to radon gas radon is produced by the natural breakdown of uranium in soil rock and water that eventually becomes part of the air you breathe unsafe levels of radon can accumulate in any building including homes exposure to asbestos and other carcinogens workplace exposure to asbestos and other substances known to cause cancer such as arsenic chromium and nickel can increase your risk of developing lung cancer especially if youre a smoker family history of lung cancer people with a parent sibling or child with lung cancer have an increased risk of the disease,lung cancer can cause complications such as shortness of breath people with lung cancer can experience shortness of breath if cancer grows to block the major airways lung cancer can also cause fluid to accumulate around the lungs making it harder for the affected lung to expand fully when you inhale coughing up blood lung cancer can cause bleeding in the airway which can cause you to cough up blood hemoptysis sometimes bleeding can become severe treatments are available to control bleeding pain advanced lung cancer that spreads to the lining of a lung or to another area of the body such as a bone can cause pain tell your doctor if you experience pain as many treatments are available to control pain fluid in the chest pleural effusion lung cancer can cause fluid to accumulate in the space that surrounds the affected lung in the chest cavity pleural space fluid accumulating in the chest can cause shortness of breath treatments are available to drain the fluid from your chest and reduce the risk that pleural effusion will occur again cancer that spreads to other parts of the body metastasis lung cancer often spreads metastasizes to other parts of the body such as the brain and the bones cancer that spreads can cause pain nausea headaches or other signs and symptoms depending on what organ is affected once lung cancer has spread beyond the lungs its generally not curable treatments are available to decrease signs and symptoms and to help you live longer,theres no sure way to prevent lung cancer but you can reduce your risk if you dont smoke if youve never smoked dont start talk to your children about not smoking so that they can understand how to avoid this major risk factor for lung cancer begin conversations about the dangers of smoking with your children early so that they know how to react to peer pressure stop smoking stop smoking now quitting reduces your risk of lung cancer even if youve smoked for years talk to your doctor about strategies and stopsmoking aids that can help you quit options include nicotine replacement products medications and support groups avoid secondhand smoke if you live or work with a smoker urge him or her to quit at the very least ask him or her to smoke outside avoid areas where people smoke such as bars and restaurants and seek out smokefree options test your home for radon have the radon levels in your home checked especially if you live in an area where radon is known to be a problem high radon levels can be remedied to make your home safer for information on radon testing contact your local department of public health or a local chapter of the american lung association avoid carcinogens at work take precautions to protect yourself from exposure to toxic chemicals at work follow your employers precautions for instance if youre given a face mask for protection always wear it ask your doctor what more you can do to protect yourself at work your risk of lung damage from workplace carcinogens increases if you smoke eat a diet full of fruits and vegetables choose a healthy diet with a variety of fruits and vegetables food sources of vitamins and nutrients are best avoid taking large doses of vitamins in pill form as they may be harmful for instance researchers hoping to reduce the risk of lung cancer in heavy smokers gave them beta carotene supplements results showed the supplements actually increased the risk of cancer in smokers exercise most days of the week if you dont exercise regularly start out slowly try to exercise most days of the week by mayo clinic staff lung cancer care at mayo clinic request an appointment diagnosis treatment march 22 2022 print share on facebooktwitter living

heartbeat or if you feel foggy and have trouble concentrating  causesthe main cause of copd in developed countries is tobacco smoking in the developing world copd often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes only some chronic smokers develop clinically apparent copd although many smokers with long smoking histories may develop reduced lung function some smokers develop less common lung conditions they may be misdiagnosed as having copd until a more thorough evaluation is performed how your lungs are affectedair travels down your windpipe trachea and into your lungs through two large tubes bronchi inside your lungs these tubes divide many times like the branches of a tree into many smaller tubes bronchioles that end in clusters of tiny air sacs alveoli the air sacs have very thin walls full of tiny blood vessels capillaries the oxygen in the air you inhale passes into these blood vessels and enters your bloodstream at the same time carbon dioxide a gas that is a waste product of metabolism is exhaled your lungs rely on the natural elasticity of the bronchial tubes and air sacs to force air out of your body copd causes them to lose their elasticity and overexpand which leaves some air trapped in your lungs when you exhale emphysema enlarge image close emphysema emphysema in emphysema the inner walls of the lungs air sacs alveoli are damaged causing them to eventually rupture this creates one larger air space instead of many small ones and reduces the surface area available for gas exchange bronchitis enlarge image close bronchitis bronchitis bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes which carry air to and from your lungs people who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus which can be discolored causes of airway obstructioncauses of airway obstruction include emphysema this lung disease causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli small airways collapse when you exhale impairing airflow out of your lungs chronic bronchitis in this condition your bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrowed and your lungs produce more mucus which can further block the narrowed tubes you develop a chronic cough trying to clear your airways cigarette smoke and other irritantsin the vast majority of people with copd the lung damage that leads to copd is caused by longterm cigarette smoking but there are likely other factors at play in the development of copd such as a genetic susceptibility to the disease because not all smokers develop copd other irritants can cause copd including cigar smoke secondhand smoke pipe smoke air pollution and workplace exposure to dust smoke or fumes alpha1antitrypsin deficiencyin about 1 of people with copd the disease results from a genetic disorder that causes low levels of a protein called alpha1antitrypsin aat aat is made in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream to help protect the lungs alpha1antitrypsin deficiency can cause liver disease lung disease or both for adults with copd related to aat deficiency treatment options include those used for people with morecommon types of copd in addition some people can be treated by replacing the missing aat protein which may prevent further damage to the lungs risk factorsrisk factors for copd include exposure to tobacco smoke the most significant risk factor for copd is longterm cigarette smoking the more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke the greater your risk pipe smokers cigar smokers and marijuana smokers also may be at risk as well as people exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke people with asthma asthma a chronic inflammatory airway disease may be a risk factor for developing copd the combination of asthma and smoking increases the risk of copd even more occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals longterm exposure to chemical fumes vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and inflame your lungs exposure to fumes from burning fuel in the developing world people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes are at higher risk of developing copd genetics the uncommon genetic disorder alpha1antitrypsin deficiency is the cause of some cases of copd other genetic factors likely make certain smokers more susceptible to the disease,copd can cause many complications including respiratory infections people with copd are more likely to catch colds the flu and pneumonia any respiratory infection can make it much more difficult to breathe and could cause further damage to lung tissue heart problems for reasons that arent fully understood copd can increase your risk of heart disease including heart attack lung cancer people with copd have a higher risk of developing lung cancer high blood pressure in lung arteries copd may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs pulmonary hypertension depression difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy and dealing with serious illness can contribute to the development of depression,unlike some diseases copd typically has a clear cause and a clear path of prevention and there are ways to slow the progression of the disease the majority of cases are directly related to cigarette smoking and the best way to prevent copd is to never smoke or to stop smoking now if youre a longtime smoker these simple statements may not seem so simple especially if youve tried quitting once twice or many times before but keep trying to quit its critical to find a tobacco cessation program that can help you quit for good its your best chance for reducing damage to your lungs occupational exposure to chemical fumes and dusts is another risk factor for copd if you work with these types of lung irritants talk to your supervisor about the best ways to protect yourself such as using respiratory protective equipment here are some steps you can take to help prevent complications associated with copd quit smoking to help reduce your risk of heart disease and lung cancer get an annual flu vaccination and regular vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia to reduce your risk of or prevent some infections talk to your doctor if you feel sad or helpless or think that you may be experiencing depression by

8,description,the signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu but they last longer signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include chest pain when you breathe or cough confusion or changes in mental awareness in adults age 65 and older cough which may produce phlegm fatigue fever sweating and shaking chills lower than normal body temperature in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems nausea vomiting or diarrhea shortness of breath newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection or they may vomit have a fever and cough appear restless or tired and without energy or have difficulty breathing and eating when to see a doctor see your doctor if you have difficulty breathing chest pain persistent fever of 102 f 39 c or higher or persistent cough especially if youre coughing up pus its especially important that people in these highrisk groups see a doctor adults older than age 65 children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms people with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system people receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system for some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems pneumonia can quickly become a lifethreatening condition,many germs can cause pneumonia the most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs but sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system even if your health is generally good pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you got the infection communityacquired pneumonia communityacquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia it occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities it may be caused by bacteria the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the us is streptococcus pneumoniae this type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after youve had a cold or the flu it may affect one part lobe of the lung a condition called lobar pneumonia bacterialike organisms mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia it typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia which typically isnt severe enough to require bed rest fungi this type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms the fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location viruses including covid19 some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years viral pneumonia is usually mild but in some cases it can become very serious coronavirus 2019 covid19 may cause pneumonia which can become severe hospitalacquired pneumonia some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness hospitalacquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick people who are on breathing machines ventilators often used in intensive care units are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia health careacquired pneumonia health careacquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people

9,description,you can have emphysema for many years without noticing any signs or symptoms the main symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath which usually begins gradually you may start avoiding activities that cause you to be short of breath so the symptom doesnt become a problem until it starts interfering with daily tasks emphysema eventually,shortness of breath in people with emphysema the air sacs in the lungs alveoli are damaged over time the inner walls of the air sacs weaken and rupture creating larger air spaces instead of many small ones this reduces the surface area of the lungs and in turn the amount of oxygen that reaches your bloodstream when you exhale the damaged alveoli dont work properly and old air becomes trapped leaving no room for fresh oxygenrich air to enter most people with emphysema also have chronic bronchitis chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the tubes that carry air to your lungs bronchial tubes which leads to a persistent cough emphysema and chronic bronchitis are two conditions that make up chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd smoking is the leading cause of copd treatment may slow the progression of copd but it cant reverse

or out of shape seek immediate medical attention if youre so short of breath you cant climb stairs your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray with exertion youre not mentally alert  causesthe main cause of emphysema is longterm exposure to airborne irritants including tobacco smoke marijuana smoke air pollution chemical fumes and dust rarely emphysema is caused by an inherited deficiency of a protein that protects the elastic structures in the lungs its called alpha1antitrypsin deficiency emphysema risk factorsfactors that increase your risk of developing emphysema include smoking emphysema is most likely to develop in cigarette smokers but cigar and pipe smokers also are susceptible the risk for all types of smokers increases with the number of years and amount of tobacco smoked age although the lung damage that occurs in emphysema develops gradually most people with tobaccorelated emphysema begin to experience symptoms of the disease between the ages of 40 and 60 exposure to secondhand smoke secondhand smoke also known as passive or environmental tobacco smoke is smoke that you inadvertently inhale from someone elses cigarette pipe or cigar being around secondhand smoke increases your risk of emphysema occupational exposure to fumes or dust if you breathe fumes from certain chemicals or dust from grain cotton wood or mining products youre more likely to develop emphysema this risk is even greater if you smoke exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution breathing indoor pollutants such as fumes from heating fuel as well as outdoor pollutants car exhaust for instance increases your risk of emphysema,people who have emphysema are also more likely to develop collapsed lung pneumothorax a collapsed lung can be lifethreatening in people who have severe emphysema because the function of their lungs is already so compromised this is uncommon but serious when it occurs heart problems emphysema can increase the pressure in the arteries that connect the heart and lungs this can cause a condition called cor pulmonale in which a section of the heart expands and weakens large holes in the lungs bullae some people with emphysema develop empty spaces in the lungs called bullae they can be as large as half the lung in addition to reducing the amount of space available for the lung to expand giant bullae can increase your risk of pneumothorax

heart disease if you think you may symptoms of heart disease make an appointment to see your provider,heart disease causes depend on the specific type of heart disease there are many different types of heart disease how the heart works chambers and valves of the heart enlarge image close chambers and valves of the heart chambers and valves of the heart a typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers the upper chambers the right and left atria receive incoming blood the lower chambers the more muscular right and left ventricles pump blood out of the heart the heart valves which keep blood flowing in the right direction are gates at the chamber openings to understand the causes of heart disease it may help to understand how the heart works the heart is divided into chambers two upper chambers atria and two lower chambers ventricles the right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels pulmonary arteries in the lungs blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins the left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body heart valvesfour heart valves the aortic mitral pulmonary and tricuspid keep the blood moving the right way the valves open only one way and only when they need to valves must open all the way and close tightly so theres no leakage heartbeatsa beating heart squeezes contracts and relaxes in a continuous cycle during contraction systole the lower heart chambers ventricles squeeze tight this action forces blood to the lungs and the rest of the body during relaxation diastole the ventricles fill with blood from the upper heart chambers atria electrical systemthe hearts electrical system keeps it beating the heartbeat controls the continuous exchange of oxygenrich blood with oxygenpoor blood this exchange keeps you alive electrical signals start in the upper right chamber right atrium the signals travel through specialized pathways to the lower heart chambers ventricles this tells the heart to pump causes of coronary artery disease development of atherosclerosis enlarge image close development of atherosclerosis development of atherosclerosis if theres too much cholesterol in the blood the cholesterol and other substances may form deposits plaques that collect on artery walls plaques can cause an artery to become narrowed or blocked if a plaque ruptures a blood clot can form plaques and blood clots can reduce blood flow through an artery a buildup of fatty plaques in the arteries atherosclerosis is the most common cause of coronary artery disease risk factors include a poor diet lack of exercise obesity and smoking healthy lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of atherosclerosis causes of irregular heartbeats arrhythmiascommon causes of arrhythmias or conditions that can lead to them include cardiomyopathy coronary artery disease diabetes drug misuse emotional stress excessive use of alcohol or caffeine heart problem present at birth congenital heart defects high blood pressure smoking heart valve disease use of certain medications including those bought without a prescription and herbs and supplements causes of congenital heart defectsa congenital heart defect develops while a baby is growing in the womb a congenital heart defect forms as the babys heart develops about a month after conception congenital heart defects change the flow of blood in the heart some medical conditions medications and genes increase the risk of congenital heart defects causes of a thickened or enlarged heart muscle cardiomyopathythe cause of cardiomyopathy depends on the type dilated cardiomyopathy the cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown it may be passed down through families inherited dilated cardiomyopathy typically starts in the hearts main pumping chamber left ventricle many things can cause damage to the left ventricle including heart attacks infections toxins and some drugs including cancer medicines hypertrophic cardiomyopathy this type is usually passed down through families inherited restrictive cardiomyopathy this is the least common type of cardiomyopathy it can occur for no known reason sometimes its caused by a buildup of protein called amyloid in the heart cardiac amyloidosis or connective tissue disorders causes of heart infectiona heart infection such as endocarditis occurs when germs reach the heart or heart valves the most common causes of heart infections are bacteria viruses parasites causes of heart valve diseasemany things can cause diseases of the heart valves some people are born with heart valve disease congenital heart valve disease heart valve disease may also be caused by conditions such as rheumatic fever infections infectious endocarditis connective tissue disorders more informationheart disease care at mayo clinicomega6 fatty acids risk factorsrisk factors for heart disease include age growing older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle sex men are generally at greater risk of heart disease the risk for women increases after menopause family history a family history of heart disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease especially if a parent developed it at an early age before age 55 for a male relative such as your brother or father and 65 for a female relative such as your mother or sister smoking if you smoke quit substances in tobacco smoke damage the arteries heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers if you need help quitting talk to your health care provider about strategies that can help unhealthy diet diets high in fat salt sugar and cholesterol have been linked to heart disease high blood pressure uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause the arteries to become hard and thick these changes interrupt blood flow to the heart and body high cholesterol having high cholesterol increases the risk of atherosclerosis atherosclerosis has been linked to heart attacks and strokes diabetes diabetes increases the risk of heart disease obesity and high blood pressure increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease obesity excess weight typically worsens other heart disease risk factors lack of exercises being inactive sedentary lifestyle is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its risk factors too stress unrelieved stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease poor dental health its important to brush and floss your teeth and gums often also get regular dental checkups unhealthy teeth and gums makes it easier for germs to enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart this can cause endocarditis,complications of heart disease include heart failure this is one of the most common complications of heart disease heart failure occurs when the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs heart attack a heart attack may occur if a blood clot is stuck in a blood vessel that goes to the heart stroke the risk factors that lead to heart disease can also lead to an ischemic stroke this type of stroke happens when the arteries to the brain are narrowed or blocked too little blood reaches the brain a stroke is a medical emergency brain tissue begins to die within just a few minutes of a stroke aneurysm an aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of an artery if an aneurysm bursts you may have lifethreatening internal bleeding peripheral artery disease in this condition the arms or legs usually the legs dont get enough blood this causes symptoms most notably leg pain when walking claudication atherosclerosis can lead to peripheral artery disease sudden cardiac arrest

14,description,diagnosis and treatment whether youre looking for answers for yourself or someone you love were here to give you the best information available youve likely heard the term stroke before they affect about 800000 people in the united states each year strokes happen in two ways in the first a blocked artery can cut off blood to an area of the brain and this is known as an ischemic stroke 85 of strokes are of this type the second type of stroke happens when a blood vessel can leak or burst so the blood spills into the brain tissue or surrounding the brain and this is called a hemorrhagic stroke prompt treatment can reduce brain damage and the likelihood of death or disability so if you or someone you know is experiencing a stroke you should call 911 and seek emergency medical care right away anyone can have a stroke but some things put you at higher risk and some things can lower your risk if youre 55 and older if youre africanamerican if youre a man or if you have a family history of strokes or heart attacks your chances of having a stroke are higher being overweight physically inactive drinking alcohol heavily recreational drug use those who smoke have high blood pressure or high cholesterol have poorly controlled diabetes suffer from obstructive sleep apnea or have certain forms of heart disease are at greater risk as well look for these signs and symptoms if you think you or someone you know is having a stroke sudden trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying paralysis or numbness of the face arm or leg on one side of the body problems seeing in one or both eyes trouble walking and a loss of balance now many strokes are not associated with headache but a sudden and severe headache can sometimes occur with some types of stroke if you notice any of these even if they come and go or disappear completely seek emergency medical attention or call 911 dont wait to see if symptoms stop for every minute counts once you get to the hospital your emergency team will review your symptoms and complete a physical exam they will use several tests to help them figure out what type of stroke youre having and determine the best treatment for the stroke this could include a ct scan or mri scan which are pictures of the brain and arteries a carotid ultrasound which is a soundwave test of the carotid arteries which provide blood flow to the front parts of the brain and blood tests once your doctors can determine if youre having an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke theyll be able to figure out the best treatment if youre suffering an ischemic stroke its important to restore blood flow to your brain as quickly as possible providing the oxygen and other nutrients your brain cells need to survive to do this doctors may use an intravenous clot buster medicine dissolving the clot that is obstructing the blood flow or they may perform an emergency endovascular procedure this involves advancing a tiny plastic tube called a catheter up into the brain arteries allowing the blockage in the artery to be removed directly unlike ischemic strokes the goal for treating a hemorrhagic stroke is to control the bleeding and reduce pressure in the brain doctors may use emergency medicines to lower the blood pressure prevent blood vessel spasms encourage clotting and prevent seizures or if the bleeding is severe surgery may be performed to remove the blood that is in the brain every stroke is different and so every persons road to recovery is different management of a stroke often involves a care team with several specialties this may include a neurologist and a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician among others now in the end our goal is to help you recover as much function as possible so that you can live independently a stroke is a lifechanging event that can affect you emotionally as much as it can physically you may feel helpless frustrated or depressed so look for help and support from friends and family accept that recovery will take hard work and most of all time strive for a new normal and remember to celebrate your progress if youd like to learn even more about strokes watch our other related videos or visit mayoclinicorg we wish you all the best an ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients brain cells begin to die in minutes a stroke is a medical emergency and prompt treatment is crucial early action can reduce brain damage and other complications the good news is that many fewer americans die of stroke now than in the past effective treatments can also help prevent disability from strokeproducts servicesassortment of products for independent living from mayo

youre with someone you suspect is having a stroke watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance,there are two main causes of stroke a blocked artery ischemic stroke or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel hemorrhagic stroke some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain known as a transient ischemic attack tia that doesnt cause lasting symptoms ischemic stroke ischemic stroke enlarge image close ischemic stroke ischemic stroke an ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot known as a thrombus blocks or plugs an artery leading to the brain a blood clot often forms in arteries damaged by a buildup of plaques known as atherosclerosis it can occur in the carotid artery of the neck as well as other arteries this is the most common type of stroke it happens when the brains blood vessels become narrowed or blocked causing severely reduced blood flow ischemia blocked or narrowed blood vessels are caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels or by blood clots or other debris that travel through the bloodstream most often from the heart and lodge in the blood vessels in the brain some initial research shows that covid19 infection may increase the risk of ischemic stroke but more study is needed hemorrhagic strokehemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect the blood vessels factors related to hemorrhagic stroke include uncontrolled high blood pressure overtreatment with blood thinners anticoagulants bulges at weak spots in your blood vessel walls aneurysms trauma such as a car accident protein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall cerebral amyloid angiopathy ischemic stroke leading to hemorrhage a less common cause of bleeding in the brain is the rupture of an irregular tangle of thinwalled blood vessels arteriovenous malformation transient ischemic attack tiaa transient ischemic attack tia sometimes known as a ministroke is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those in a stroke a tia doesnt cause permanent damage a tia is caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain which may last as little as five minutes like an ischemic stroke a tia occurs when a clot or debris reduces or blocks blood flow to part of the nervous system seek emergency care even if you think youve had a tia because your symptoms got better its not possible to tell if youre having a stroke or tia based only on the symptoms if youve had a tia it means you may have a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to the brain having a tia increases your risk of having a fullblown stroke later risk factorsmany factors can increase the risk of stroke potentially treatable stroke risk factors include lifestyle risk factors being overweight or obese physical inactivity heavy or binge drinking use of illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine medical risk factors high blood pressure cigarette smoking or secondhand smoke exposure high cholesterol diabetes obstructive sleep apnea cardiovascular disease including heart failure heart defects heart infection or irregular heart rhythm such as atrial fibrillation personal or family history of stroke heart attack or transient ischemic attack covid19 infection other factors associated with a

complicationsa stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities depending on how long the brain lacks blood flow and which part is affected complications may include paralysis or loss of muscle movement you may become paralyzed on one side of the body or lose control of certain muscles such as those on one side of the face or one arm difficulty talking or swallowing a stroke might affect control of the muscles in the mouth and throat making it difficult for you to talk clearly swallow or eat you also may have difficulty with language including speaking or understanding speech reading or writing memory loss or thinking difficulties many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss others may have difficulty thinking reasoning making judgments and understanding concepts emotional problems people who have had strokes may have more difficulty controlling their emotions or they may develop depression pain pain numbness or other unusual sensations may occur in the parts of the body affected by stroke for example if a stroke causes you to lose feeling in the left arm you may develop an uncomfortable tingling sensation in that arm changes in behavior and selfcare ability people who have had strokes may become more withdrawn they may need help with grooming and daily chores,knowing your stroke risk factors following your health care providers recommendations and adopting a healthy lifestyle are the best steps you can take to prevent a stroke if youve had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack tia these measures might help prevent another stroke the followup care you receive in the hospital and afterward also may play a role many stroke prevention strategies are the same as strategies to prevent heart disease in general healthy lifestyle recommendations include controlling high blood pressure hypertension this is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your stroke risk if youve had a stroke lowering your blood pressure can help prevent a subsequent tia or stroke healthy lifestyle changes and medications are often used to treat high blood pressure lowering the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in your diet eating less cholesterol and fat especially saturated fat and trans fats may reduce buildup in the arteries if you cant control your cholesterol through dietary changes alone your doctor may prescribe a cholesterollowering medication quitting tobacco use smoking raises the risk of stroke for smokers and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke quitting tobacco use reduces the risk of stroke managing diabetes diet exercise and losing weight can help you keep your blood sugar in a healthy range if lifestyle factors dont seem to be enough to control your diabetes your doctor may prescribe diabetes medication maintaining a healthy weight being overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure cardiovascular disease and diabetes eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables a diet containing five or more daily servings of fruits or vegetables may reduce the risk of stroke the mediterranean diet which emphasizes olive oil fruit nuts vegetables and whole grains may be helpful exercising regularly aerobic exercise reduces the risk of stroke in many ways exercise can lower blood pressure increase the levels of good cholesterol and improve the overall health of the blood vessels and heart it also helps you lose weight control diabetes and reduce stress gradually work up to at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity such as walking jogging swimming or bicycling on most if not all days of the week drinking alcohol in moderation if at all heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk of high blood pressure ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes alcohol may also interact with other drugs youre taking however drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol such as one drink a day may help prevent ischemic stroke and decrease the bloods clotting tendency talk to your doctor about whats appropriate for you treating obstructive sleep apnea osa your doctor may recommend a sleep study if you have symptoms of osa a sleep disorder that causes you to stop breathing for short periods repeatedly during sleep treatment for osa includes a device that delivers positive airway pressure through a mask to keep the airway open while you sleep avoiding illegal drugs certain street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are established risk factors for a tia or a stroke preventive medicationsif youve had an ischemic stroke or a tia your doctor may recommend medications to help reduce your risk of having another stroke these include antiplatelet drugs platelets are cells in the blood that form clots antiplatelet drugs make these cells less sticky and less likely to clot the most commonly used antiplatelet medication is aspirin your doctor can help you determine the right dose of aspirin for you after a tia or minor stroke your doctor may give you aspirin and an antiplatelet drug such as clopidogrel plavix for a period of time to reduce the risk of another stroke if you cant take aspirin your doctor may prescribe clopidogrel alone anticoagulants these drugs reduce blood clotting heparin is fast acting and may be used shortterm in the hospital sloweracting warfarin jantoven may be used over a longer term warfarin is a powerful bloodthinning drug so youll need to take it exactly as directed and watch for side effects youll also need to have regular blood tests to monitor warfarins effects several newer bloodthinning medications anticoagulants are available for preventing strokes in people who have a high risk these medications include dabigatran pradaxa rivaroxaban xarelto apixaban eliquis and edoxaban savaysa theyre shorter acting than warfarin and usually dont require regular blood tests or monitoring by your doctor these drugs are also associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to

15,description,diagnosis and treatment whether youre looking for answers for yourself or someone you love we are here to give you the best information available type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the insulin making cells of the pancreas its estimated that about 125 million americans live with it people with type 1 diabetes dont make enough insulin an important hormone produced by the pancreas insulin allows your cells to store sugar or glucose and fat and produce energy unfortunately there is no known cure but treatment can prevent complications and also improve everyday life for patients with type 1 diabetes lots of people with type 1 diabetes live a full life and the more we learn and develop treatment for the disorder the better the outcome we dont know what exactly,type 1 diabetes we believe that it is an autoimmune disorder where the body mistakenly destroys insulin producing cells in the pancreas typically the pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream the insulin circulates letting sugar enter your cells this sugar or glucose is the main source of energy for cells in the brain muscle cells and other tissues however once most insulin producing cells are destroyed the pancreas cant produce enough insulin meaning the glucose cant enter the cells resulting in an excess of blood sugar floating in the bloodstream this can cause lifethreatening,and also improve everyday life for patients with type 1 diabetes lots of people with type 1 diabetes live a full life and the more we learn and develop treatment for the disorder the better the outcome we dont know what exactly causes type 1 diabetes we believe that it is an autoimmune disorder where the body mistakenly destroys insulin producing cells in the pancreas typically the pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream the insulin circulates letting sugar enter your cells this sugar or glucose is the main source of energy for cells in the brain muscle cells and other tissues however once most insulin producing cells are destroyed the pancreas cant produce enough insulin meaning the glucose cant enter the cells resulting in an excess of blood sugar floating in the bloodstream this can cause lifethreatening complications and this condition is called diabetic ketoacidosis although we dont know what causes it we do know certain factors can contribute to the onset of type 1 diabetes family history anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing it genetics the presence of certain genes can also indicate an increased risk geography type 1 diabetes becomes more common as you travel away from the equator age although it can occur at any age there are two noticeable peaks the first occurs in children between four and seven years of age and the second is between 10 and 14 years old signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes can appear rather suddenly especially in children they may include increased thirst frequent urination bed wetting in children who previously didnt wet the bed extreme hunger unintended weight loss fatigue and weakness blurred vision irritability and other mood changes if you or your child are experiencing any of these symptoms you should talk to your doctor the best way to determine if you have type 1 diabetes is a blood test there are different methods such as an a1c test a random blood sugar test or a fasting blood sugar test they are all effective and your doctor can help determine whats appropriate for you if you are diagnosed with diabetes your doctor may order additional tests to check for antibodies that are common in type 1 diabetes in the test called cpeptide which measures the amount of insulin produced when checked simultaneously with a fasting glucose these tests can help distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes when a diagnosis is uncertain if you have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes you may be wondering what treatment looks like it could mean taking insulin counting carbohydrates fat protein and monitoring your glucose frequently eating healthy foods and exercising regularly to maintain a healthy weight generally those with type 1 diabetes will need lifelong insulin therapy there are many different types of insulin and more are being developed that are more efficient and what you may take may change again your doctor will help you navigate whats right for you a significant advance in treatment from the last several years has been the development and availability of continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps that automatically adjust insulin working with the continuous glucose monitor this type of treatment is the best treatment at this time for type 1 diabetes this is an exciting time for patients and for physicians that are keen to develop prescribe such therapies surgery is another option a successful pancreas transplant can erase the need for additional insulin however transplants arent always available not successful and the procedure can pose serious risks sometimes it may outweigh the dangers of diabetes itself so transplants are often reserved for those with very difficult to manage conditions a successful transplant can bring life transforming results however surgery is always a serious endeavor and requires ample research and concentration from you your family and your medical team the fact that we dont know what causes type 1 diabetes can be alarming the fact that we dont have a cure for it even more so but with the right doctor medical team and treatment type 1 diabetes can be managed so those who live with it can get on living if you would like to learn even more about type 1 diabetes watch our other related videos or visit mayoclinicorg we wish you well diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar glucose glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues its also the brains main source of fuel the main cause of diabetes varies by type but no matter what type of diabetes you have it can lead to excess sugar in the blood too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal but the blood sugar levels arent high enough to be called diabetes and prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy but it may go away after the baby is bornproducts servicesbook future carebook the essential diabetes bookbook the mayo clinic diabetes dietshow more products from mayo clinic symptomsdiabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is some people especially if they have prediabetes gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes may not have symptoms in type 1 diabetes symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe some of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are feeling more thirsty than usual urinating often losing weight without trying presence of ketones in the urine ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when theres not enough available insulin feeling tired and weak feeling irritable or having other mood changes having blurry vision having slowhealing sores getting a lot of infections such as gum skin and vaginal infections type 1 diabetes can start at any age but it often starts during childhood or teen years type 2 diabetes the more common type can develop at any age type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40 but type 2 diabetes in children is increasing when to see a doctor if you think you or your child may have diabetes if you notice any possible diabetes symptoms contact your health care provider the earlier the condition is diagnosed the sooner treatment can begin if youve already been diagnosed with diabetes after you receive your diagnosis youll need close medical followup until your blood sugar levels stabilize  causesto understand diabetes its important to understand how the body normally uses glucose how insulin worksinsulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach pancreas the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream the insulin circulates letting sugar enter the cells insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream as the blood sugar level drops so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas the role of glucoseglucose a sugar is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues glucose comes from two major sources food and the liver sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream where it enters cells with the help of insulin the liver stores and makes glucose when glucose levels are low such as when you havent eaten in a while the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose this keeps your glucose level within a typical range the exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown in all cases sugar builds up in the bloodstream this is because the pancreas doesnt produce enough insulin both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors it is unclear what those factors may be risk factorsrisk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes family history may play a part in all types environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells autoantibodies if you have these autoantibodies you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes but not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes race or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes although its unclear why certain people including black hispanic american indian and asian american people are at higher risk prediabetes type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are more common in people who are overweight or obese complicationslongterm complications of diabetes develop gradually the longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar the higher the risk of complications eventually diabetes complications may be disabling or even lifethreatening in fact prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes possible complications include heart and blood vessel cardiovascular disease diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems these can include coronary artery disease with chest pain angina heart attack stroke and narrowing of arteries atherosclerosis if you have diabetes youre more likely to have heart disease or stroke nerve damage from diabetes diabetic neuropathy too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels capillaries that nourish the nerves especially in the legs this can cause tingling numbness burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea vomiting diarrhea or constipation for men it may lead to erectile dysfunction kidney damage from diabetes diabetic nephropathy the kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters glomeruli that filter waste from the blood diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system eye damage from diabetes diabetic retinopathy diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye this could lead to blindness foot damage nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications skin and mouth conditions diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems including bacterial and fungal infections hearing impairment hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes alzheimers disease type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia such as alzheimers disease depression related to diabetes depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes complications of gestational diabetesmost women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies however untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby complications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes including excess growth extra glucose can cross the placenta extra glucose triggers the babys pancreas to make extra insulin this can cause your baby to grow too large it can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a csection low blood sugar sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar hypoglycemia shortly after birth this is because their own insulin production is high type 2 diabetes later in life babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life death untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a babys death either before or shortly after birth complications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes including preeclampsia symptoms of this condition include high blood pressure too much protein in the urine and swelling in the legs and feet gestational diabetes if you had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy youre more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy,type 1 diabetes cant be prevented but the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them eat healthy foods choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber focus on fruits vegetables and whole grains eat a variety to keep from feeling bored get more physical activity try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week for example take a brisk daily walk if you cant fit in a long workout break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day lose excess pounds if youre overweight losing even 7 of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes for example if you weigh 200 pounds 907 kilograms losing 14 pounds 64 kilograms can lower the risk of diabetes but dont try to lose weight during pregnancy talk to your provider about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy to keep your weight in a healthy range work on longterm changes to your eating and exercise habits remember the benefits of losing weight such as a healthier heart more energy and higher selfesteem sometimes drugs are an option oral diabetes drugs such as metformin glumetza fortamet others may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes but healthy lifestyle choices are important if you have prediabetes have your blood sugar checked at least once a year

18,description,signs and symptoms of malaria may include fever chills general feeling of discomfort headache nausea and vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain muscle or joint pain fatigue rapid breathing rapid heart rate cough some people who have malaria experience cycles of malaria attacks an attack usually starts with shivering and chills followed by a high fever followed by sweating and a return to normal temperature malaria signs and symptoms typically begin within a few weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito however some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in your body for up to a year when to see a doctortalk to your doctor if you experience a fever while living in or after traveling to a highrisk malaria region if you have severe symptoms seek emergency medical attention,malaria transmission cycle enlarge image close malaria transmission cycle malaria transmission cycle malaria spreads when a mosquito becomes infected with the disease after biting an infected person and the infected mosquito then bites a noninfected person the malaria parasites enter that persons bloodstream and travel to the liver when the parasites mature they leave the liver and infect red blood cells malaria is caused by a singlecelled parasite of the genus plasmodium the parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites mosquito transmission cycle uninfected mosquito a mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria transmission of parasite if this mosquito bites you in the future it can transmit malaria parasites to you in the liver once the parasites enter your body they travel to your liver where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year into the bloodstream when the parasites mature they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells this is when people typically develop malaria symptoms on to the next person if an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the other people it bites other modes of transmissionbecause the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells people can also catch malaria from exposure to infected blood including from mother to unborn child through blood transfusions by sharing needles used to inject drugs risk factorsthe greatest risk factor for developing malaria is to live in or to visit areas where the disease is common these include the tropical and subtropical regions of subsaharan africa south and southeast asia pacific islands central america and northern

increased risk of serious disease include young children and infants older adults travelers coming from areas with no malaria pregnant women and their unborn children in many countries with high malaria rates the problem is worsened by lack of access to preventive measures medical care and information immunity can waneresidents of a malaria region may be exposed to the disease enough to acquire a partial immunity which can lessen the severity of malaria symptoms however this partial immunity can disappear if you move to a place where youre no longer frequently exposed to the parasite,malaria can be fatal particularly when caused by the plasmodium species common in africa the world health organization estimates that about 94 of all malaria deaths occur in africa most commonly in children under the age of 5 malaria deaths are usually related to one or more serious complications including cerebral malaria if parasitefilled blood cells block small blood vessels to your brain cerebral malaria swelling of your brain or brain damage may occur cerebral malaria may cause seizures and coma breathing problems accumulated fluid in your lungs pulmonary edema can make it difficult to breathe organ failure malaria can damage the kidneys or liver or cause the spleen to rupture any of these conditions can be lifethreatening anemia malaria may result in not having enough red blood cells for an adequate supply of oxygen to your bodys tissues anemia low blood sugar severe forms of malaria can cause low blood sugar hypoglycemia as can quinine a common medication used to

meningitis in infants young children and adults in the united states it more commonly causes pneumonia or ear or sinus infections a vaccine can help prevent this infection neisseria meningitidis this bacterium causes a bacterial meningitis called meningococcal meningitis these bacteria commonly cause an upper respiratory infection but can cause meningococcal meningitis when they enter the bloodstream this is a highly contagious infection that affects mainly teenagers and young adults it may cause local epidemics in college dormitories boarding schools and military bases a vaccine can help prevent infection even if vaccinated anybody who has been in close contact with a person with meningococcal meningitis should receive an oral antibiotic to prevent the disease haemophilus

can cause meningitis can spread through coughing sneezing kissing or sharing eating utensils a toothbrush or a cigarette these steps can help prevent meningitis wash your hands careful handwashing helps prevent the spread of germs teach children to wash their hands often especially before eating and after using the toilet spending time in a crowded public place or petting animals show them how to thoroughly wash and rinse their hands practice good hygiene dont share drinks foods straws eating utensils lip balms or toothbrushes with anyone else teach children and teens to avoid sharing these

a doctorget immediate care if you are experiencing any of the moresevere symptoms associated with encephalitis a severe headache fever and change in consciousness require urgent care infants and young children with any signs or symptoms of encephalitis should receive urgent care  causesin approximately half of patients the exact cause of encephalitis is not known in those for whom a cause is identified there are two main types of encephalitis infectious encephalitis this condition occurs when a virus or other agent directly infects the brain the infection may affect one area or be widespread viruses are the most common causes of infectious encephalitis including some that can be passed by mosquitoes or ticks very rarely encephalitis may be caused by bacteria fungus or parasites autoimmune encephalitis this condition occurs when your own immune cells mistakenly attack the brain or make antibodies targeting proteins and receptors in the brain the exact reason why this happens is not completely understood sometimes the abnormal immune response can be triggered by benign or cancerous tumors known as paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis other types of autoimmune encephalitis such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis adem can be triggered by infection in your body this is known as postinfectious autoimmune encephalitis in many instances no definitive trigger for the abnormal immune response is identified common viral causes west nile virus transmission cycle enlarge image close west nile virus transmission cycle west nile virus transmission cycle when a mosquito bites an infected bird the virus enters the mosquitos bloodstream and eventually moves into its salivary glands when an infected mosquito bites an animal or a human host the virus is passed into the hosts bloodstream where it may cause serious illness the viruses that can cause encephalitis include herpes simplex virus hsv both hsv type 1 associated with cold sores and fever blisters around your mouth and hsv type 2 associated with genital herpes can cause encephalitis encephalitis caused by hsv type 1 is rare but can result in significant brain damage or death other herpes viruses these include the epsteinbarr virus which commonly causes infectious mononucleosis and the varicellazoster virus which commonly causes chickenpox and shingles enteroviruses these viruses include the poliovirus and the coxsackievirus which usually cause an illness with flulike symptoms eye inflammation and abdominal pain mosquitoborne viruses these viruses can cause infections such as west nile la crosse st louis western equine and eastern equine encephalitis symptoms of an infection might appear within a few days to a couple of weeks after exposure to a mosquitoborne virus tickborne viruses the powassan virus is carried by ticks and causes encephalitis in the midwestern united states symptoms usually appear about a week after a bite from an infected tick rabies virus infection with the rabies virus which is usually transmitted by a bite from an infected animal causes a rapid progression to encephalitis once symptoms begin rabies is a rare cause of encephalitis in the united states risk factorsanyone can develop encephalitis factors that may increase the risk include age some types of encephalitis are more common or moresevere in certain age groups in general young children and older adults are at greater risk of most types of viral encephalitis similarly some forms of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults whereas others are more common in older adults weakened immune system people who have hivaids take immunesuppressing medicines or have another condition causing a weakened immune system are at increased risk of encephalitis geographical regions mosquito or tickborne viruses are common in particular geographical regions season of the year mosquito and tickborne diseases tend to be more common in summer in many areas of the united states autoimmune disease people who already have an autoimmune condition may be more prone to develop autoimmune encephalitis smoking smoking increases the chances of developing lung cancer which in turn increases the risk of developing paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis,the complications of encephalitis vary depending on factors such as your age the cause of your infection the severity of your initial illness the time from disease onset to treatment people with relatively mild illness usually recover within a few weeks with no longterm complications complications of severe illnessinflammation can injure the brain possibly resulting in a coma or death other complications may last for months or be permanent these complications can vary widely in severity and can include persistent fatigue weakness or lack of muscle coordination personality changes memory problems hearing or vision defects speech impairments,the best way to prevent viral encephalitis is to take precautions to avoid exposure to viruses that can cause the disease try to practice good hygiene wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water particularly after using the toilet and before and after meals dont share utensils dont share tableware and beverages teach your children good habits make sure they practice good hygiene and avoid sharing utensils at home and school get vaccinations keep your own and your childrens vaccinations current before traveling talk to your health care provider about recommended vaccinations for different destinations protection against mosquitoes and ticksto minimize your exposure to mosquitoes and ticks dress to protect yourself wear longsleeved shirts and long pants if youre outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active and when youre in a wooded area with tall grasses and shrubs where ticks are more common apply mosquito repellent chemicals such as deet can be applied to both the skin and clothes to apply repellent to your face spray it on your hands and then wipe it on your face if youre using both sunscreen and a repellent apply sunscreen first use insecticide the environmental protection agency recommends the use of products containing permethrin which repels and kills ticks and mosquitoes these products can be sprayed on clothing tents and other outdoor gear permethrin shouldnt be applied to the skin avoid mosquitoes refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes are most common if possible avoid being outdoors from dusk till dawn when mosquitoes are most active repair broken windows and screens get rid of water sources outside your home eliminate standing water in your yard where mosquitoes can lay their eggs common problems include flowerpots or other gardening containers flat roofs old tires and clogged gutters look for outdoor signs of viral disease if you notice sick or dying birds or animals report your observations to your local health department protection for young childreninsect repellents arent recommended for use on infants younger than 2 months of age instead cover an infant carrier or stroller with mosquito netting for older infants and children repellents with 10 to 30 deet are considered safe products containing both deet and sunscreen arent recommended for children because reapplication which might be necessary for the sunscreen component will expose the child to too much deet tips for using mosquito repellent with children include always assist children with the use of mosquito repellent spray on clothing and exposed skin apply the repellent when outdoors to lessen the risk of inhaling the repellent spray repellent on your hands and then apply it to your childs face take care around the eyes and ears dont use repellent on the hands of young children who may put their hands in their mouths wash treated skin with soap and water when you come indoors by mayo clinic staff encephalitis care at mayo clinic

animal bite or a deep cut your wound is contaminated with dirt soil feces rust or saliva or you have any doubt about whether youve cleaned a wound sufficiently after such exposure contaminated wounds require a vaccination booster if its been five or more years since your last tetanus shot  causesthe bacterium that causes tetanus is called clostridium tetani the bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces its essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive when the dormant bacteria enter a wound a condition good for growth the cells are awakened as they are growing and dividing they release a toxin called tetanospasmin the toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles risk factorsthe greatest risk factor for tetanus infection is not being vaccinated or not keeping up with the 10year booster shots other factors that increase the risk of tetanus infection are cuts or wounds exposed to soil or manure a foreign body in a wound such as a nail or splinter a history of immunesuppressing medical conditions infected skin lesions in people living with diabetes an infected umbilical cord when a mother isnt fully vaccinated shared and unsanitary needles for illegal drug use complicationscomplications of tetanus infection may include breathing problems lifethreatening breathing problems can occur from tightening of the vocal cords and muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen especially during a generalized spasm blockage of a lung artery pulmonary embolism a blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches pneumonia a lung infection caused by accidentally inhaling something into the lungs aspiration pneumonia may be a complication of generalized spasms broken bones generalized spasms may cause fractures of the spine or other bones death death from tetanus is often caused by a blocked airway during spasms or damage to the nerves that regulate breathing heart rate or other organ functions,you can prevent tetanus by being vaccinated vaccination for childrenthe tetanus vaccine is given to children as part of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine dtap diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection of the nose and throat acellular pertussis also called whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory infection children who do not tolerate the pertussis vaccine may receive the alternative vaccine called dt the dtap is a series of five shots typically given in the arm or thigh to children at ages 2 months 4 months 6 months 15 to 18 months 4 to 6 years vaccination for children ages 7 to 18a booster shot is recommended for children at age 11 or 12 this booster is called the tdap vaccine if your child didnt

25,description,diphtheria signs and symptoms usually begin 2 to 5 days after a person becomes infected signs and symptoms may include a thick gray membrane covering the throat and tonsils a sore throat and hoarseness swollen glands enlarged lymph nodes in the neck difficulty breathing or rapid breathing nasal discharge fever and chills tiredness in some people infection with diphtheriacausing bacteria,only a mild illness or no obvious signs and symptoms at all infected people who stay unaware of their illness are known as carriers of diphtheria theyre called carriers because they can spread the infection without being sick themselves skin cutaneous diphtheriaa second type of diphtheria can affect the skin causing pain redness and swelling similar to other bacterial skin infections ulcers covered by a gray membrane also may be a sign of skin diphtheria although its more common in tropical climates diphtheria on the skin also occurs in the united states it may happen especially among people with poor hygiene who live in crowded conditions when to see a doctorcall your family doctor immediately if you or your child has been exposed to someone with diphtheria if youre not sure whether your child has been vaccinated against diphtheria schedule an appointment make sure your own vaccinations are current request an appointment causesdiphtheria is caused by the bacterium corynebacterium diphtheriae the bacterium usually multiplies on or near the surface of the throat or skin c diphtheriae spreads through airborne droplets when an infected persons sneeze or cough releases a mist of contaminated droplets people nearby may inhale c diphtheriae diphtheria spreads easily this way especially in crowded conditions contaminated personal or household items people sometimes catch diphtheria from handling an infected persons things such as used tissues or hand towels that may be contaminated with the bacteria touching an infected wound also can transfer diphtheriacausing bacteria people who have been infected by the diphtheria bacteria and who havent been treated can infect people who havent had the diphtheria vaccine even if they dont show any symptoms risk factorspeople who are at increased risk of catching diphtheria include children and adults who dont have uptodate vaccinations people living in crowded or unsanitary conditions anyone who travels to an area where diphtheria infections are more common diphtheria rarely occurs in the united states and western europe where children have been vaccinated against the condition for decades however diphtheria is still common in developing countries where vaccination rates are low in areas where diphtheria vaccination is standard the disease is mainly a threat to unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated people who travel internationally or have contact with people from less developed countries,left untreated diphtheria can lead to breathing problems diphtheriacausing bacteria may produce a toxin this toxin damages tissue in the immediate area of infection usually the nose and throat at that site the infection produces a tough gray membrane made up of dead cells bacteria and other substances this membrane can obstruct breathing heart damage the diphtheria toxin may spread through the bloodstream and damage other tissues in the body for example it can damage the heart muscle causing such complications as inflammation of the heart muscle myocarditis heart damage from myocarditis may be slight or severe at its worst myocarditis can lead to heart failure and sudden death nerve damage the toxin can also cause nerve damage typical targets are nerves to the throat where poor nerve conduction may cause difficulty swallowing nerves to the arms and legs also may become inflamed causing muscle weakness if the diphtheria toxin damages the nerves that help control muscles used in breathing these muscles may become paralyzed at that point you might need mechanical assistance to breathe with treatment most people with diphtheria survive these complications but recovery is often slow diphtheria is fatal about 5 to 10 of the time rates of death are higher in children under age 5 or adults older than age 40,before antibiotics were available diphtheria was a common illness in young children today the disease is not only treatable but also preventable with a vaccine the diphtheria vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for tetanus and whooping cough pertussis the threeinone vaccine is known as the diphtheria tetanus and pertussis vaccine the latest version of this vaccine is known as the dtap vaccine for children and the tdap vaccine for adolescents and adults the diphtheria tetanus and pertussis vaccine is one of the childhood vaccinations that doctors in the united states recommend during infancy vaccination consists of a series of five shots typically administered in the arm or thigh given to children at these ages 2 months 4 months 6 months 15 to 18 months 4 to 6 years the diphtheria vaccine is effective at preventing diphtheria but there may be some side effects some children may experience a mild fever fussiness drowsiness or tenderness at the injection site after a dtap shot ask your doctor what you can do for your child to minimize or relieve these effects complications are very rare in rare cases the dtap vaccine causes serious but treatable complications in a child such as an allergic reaction hives or a rash develops within minutes of the injection some children such as those with epilepsy or another nervous system condition may not be able to get the dtap vaccine booster shotsafter the initial series of vaccinations in childhood you need booster shots of the diphtheria vaccine to help you maintain your immunity thats because immunity to diphtheria fades with time children who received all of the recommended vaccinations before age 7 should receive their first booster shot at around age 11 or 12 the next booster shot is recommended 10 years later then repeated at 10year intervals booster shots are particularly important if you travel to an area where diphtheria is common the booster is given as a tdap vaccine or as a diphtheria booster combined with the tetanus booster the tetanusdiphtheria td vaccine this combination vaccine is given by injection usually into the arm or thigh tdap is an alternative vaccine for adolescents ages 11 through 18 and adults who havent previously had a tdap booster its also recommended once during pregnancy regardless of previous vaccinations talk to your doctor about vaccines and booster shots if youre unsure of your vaccination status a tdap vaccine may also be recommended as part of the td series for children ages 7 through

27,description,once you become infected with whooping cough it takes about seven to 10 days for signs and symptoms to appear though it can sometimes take longer theyre usually mild at first and resemble those of a common cold runny nose nasal congestion red watery eyes fever cough after a week or two signs and symptoms worsen thick mucus accumulates inside your airways causing uncontrollable coughing severe and prolonged coughing attacks may provoke vomiting result in a red or blue face cause extreme fatigue end with a highpitched whoop sound during the next breath of air however many people dont develop the characteristic whoop sometimes a persistent hacking cough is the only sign that an adolescent or adult has whooping cough infants may not cough at all instead they may struggle to breathe or they may even temporarily stop breathing when to see a doctorcall your doctor if prolonged coughing spells cause you or your child to vomit turn red or blue seem to be struggling to breathe or have noticeable pauses in breathing inhale with a whooping sound,whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called bordetella pertussis when an infected person coughs or sneezes tiny germladen droplets are sprayed into the air and breathed into the lungs of anyone who happens to be nearby risk factorsthe whooping cough vaccine you receive as a child eventually wears off this leaves most teenagers and adults susceptible to the infection during an outbreak and there continue to be regular outbreaks infants who are younger than age 12 months who are unvaccinated or havent received the full set of recommended vaccines have the highest risk for severe,and death complicationsteens and adults often recover from whooping cough with no problems when complications occur they tend to be side effects of the strenuous coughing such as bruised or cracked ribs abdominal hernias broken blood vessels in the skin or the whites of your eyes infantsin infants especially those under 6 months of age complications from whooping cough are more severe and may include pneumonia slowed or stopped breathing dehydration or weight loss due to feeding difficulties seizures brain damage because infants and toddlers are at greatest risk of complications from whooping cough theyre more likely to need treatment in a hospital complications can be lifethreatening for infants younger than 6 months old,the best way to prevent whooping cough is with the pertussis vaccine which doctors often give in combination with vaccines against two other serious diseases diphtheria and tetanus doctors recommend beginning vaccination during infancy the vaccine consists of a series of five injections typically given to children at these ages 2 months 4 months 6 months 15 to 18 months 4 to 6 years vaccine side effectsside effects of the vaccine are usually mild and may include a fever crankiness headache fatigue or soreness at the site of the injection booster shots adolescents because immunity from the pertussis vaccine tends to wane by age 11 doctors recommend a booster shot at that age to protect against whooping cough pertussis diphtheria and tetanus adults some varieties of the every10year tetanus and diphtheria vaccine also include protection against whooping cough pertussis this vaccine will also reduce the risk of your transmitting whooping cough to infants pregnant women health experts now recommend that pregnant women receive the pertussis vaccine between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation this may also give some protection to the infant during the first few months of life preventive medicationsif youve been exposed to someone who has whooping cough your doctor may recommend antibiotics to protect against infection if you are a health care provider are pregnant are younger than age 12 months have a health condition that could put you at risk of severe illness or complications such as a weakened immune system or asthma live with someone who has whooping cough

way to prevent polio is vaccination polio vaccinethe cdc recommends four doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine ipv at the following ages 2 months 4 months between 6 and 18 months between ages 4 and 6 when children are just entering school if your child is missing a dose talk to your health care provider about a catchup schedule for vaccination adult vaccinationin the us most adults have immunity to the poliovirus because of childhood vaccination and us adults have little chance of being exposed to the virus but adults who are traveling to or living in a region with high rates of spreading poliovirus should receive more vaccinations if you had a complete course of vaccination you should get a onetime ipv booster you should get three ipv doses if you arent vaccinated didnt receive a complete vaccination or are unsure of your vaccination status the ipv schedule for adults is a second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose then the third dose is 6 to 12 months after the second dose talk to your health care provider if you know you have an incomplete vaccination history vaccine safetyipv is safe for people with weakened immune systems although its not certain how protective the vaccine is in cases of severe immune deficiency common side effects are pain and redness at the injection site ipv can cause an allergic reaction in some people because the vaccine has trace amounts of the antibiotics streptomycin polymyxin b and neomycin it may cause a reaction in people allergic to one of these antibiotics a person who has a severe reaction to a first dose of ipv wont get more doses signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur within minutes to a few hours after the shot watch for skin reactions including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin low blood pressure hypotension narrowing of the airways and a swollen tongue or throat which can cause wheezing and trouble breathing a weak and fast pulse nausea vomiting or diarrhea dizziness or

especially before your children start day care school or college and before international travel outside of the us  causesmeasles is a highly contagious illness this means its very easily spread to others measles is caused by a virus found in the nose and throat of an infected child or adult when someone with measles coughs sneezes or talks infectious droplets spray into the air where other people can breathe them in the infectious droplets can hang in the air for about an hour the infectious droplets may also land on a surface where they can live and spread for several hours you can get the measles virus by putting your fingers in your mouth or nose or rubbing your eyes after touching the infected surface measles is highly contagious from about four days before to four days after the rash appears about 90 of people who havent had measles or been vaccinated against measles will become infected when exposed to someone with the measles virus risk factorsrisk factors for measles include being unvaccinated if you havent had the measles vaccine youre much more likely to get measles traveling internationally if you travel to countries where measles is more common youre at higher risk of catching measles having a vitamin a deficiency if you dont have enough vitamin a in your diet youre more likely to have moresevere symptoms and,of measles complicationscomplications of measles may include diarrhea and vomiting diarrhea and vomiting can result in losing too much water from the body dehydration ear infection one of the most common complications of measles is a bacterial ear infection bronchitis laryngitis or croup measles may lead to irritation and swelling inflammation of the airways croup it can also lead to inflammation of the inner walls that line the main air passageways of the lungs bronchitis measles can also cause inflammation of the voice box laryngitis pneumonia measles can commonly cause an infection in the lungs pneumonia people with weakened immune systems can develop an especially dangerous type of pneumonia that sometimes can lead to death encephalitis about 1 in 1000 people with measles can develop a complication called encephalitis encephalitis is irritation and swelling inflammation of the brain the condition can be especially dangerous for people with weakened immune systems encephalitis may occur right after measles or it might not occur until months later encephalitis can cause permanent brain damage pregnancy problems if youre pregnant you need to take special care to avoid measles because the disease can cause premature birth low birth weight and fetal death,the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends that children and adults receive the measles vaccine to prevent measles measles vaccine in childrenthe measles vaccine is usually given as a combined measlesmumpsrubella mmr vaccine this vaccine may also include the chickenpox varicella vaccine mmrv vaccine health care providers recommend that children receive the mmr vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and again between 4 and 6 years of age before entering school the mmr vaccines two doses are 97 effective in preventing measles and protecting against it for life in the small number of people who get measles after being vaccinated the symptoms are generally mild keep in mind if youll be traveling internationally outside the us when your child is 6 to 11 months old talk with your childs health care provider about getting the measles vaccine earlier if your child or teenager didnt get the two doses of the vaccine at the recommended times your child may need two doses of the vaccine four weeks apart babies born to women who have received the vaccine or who are already immune because they had measles are usually protected from measles for about 6 months after birth if a child requires protection from measles before 12 months of age for example for foreign travel the vaccine can be given as early as 6 months of age but children who are vaccinated early still need to be vaccinated at the recommended ages later providing a child with the mmr vaccine as a combination of recommended vaccines can prevent a childs delay in protection against infection from measles mumps and rubella and with fewer shots the combination vaccine is as safe and effective as the vaccines given separately side effects are generally mild and may include a sore arm where the shot was given and fever measles vaccine in adultsyou may need the measles vaccine if youre an adult who does not have proof of immunity and has an increased risk of measles such as attending college traveling internationally outside the us or working in a hospital environment was born in 1957 or later if youve already had measles your body has built up its immune system to fight the infection and you cant get measles again most people born or living in the us before 1957 are immune to measles simply because theyve already had it proof of immunity protection from getting measles infection includes written documentation of appropriate measles vaccinations lab tests that show evidence of immunity lab tests that show youve had measles in the past if youre not sure if you need the measles vaccine talk to your health care provider preventing measles during an outbreak or known infectionif someone in your household has measles take these precautions to protect family and friends without immunity isolate because measles is highly contagious from about four days before to four days after the rash appears people with measles should stay home and not return to activities where they interact with other people during this period people who arent vaccinated siblings for example should also stay away from the infected person vaccinate be sure that anyone whos at risk of getting measles who hasnt been fully vaccinated receives the measles vaccine as soon as possible this includes infants older than 6 months and anyone born in 1957 or later who doesnt have proof of immunity preventing new infectionsgetting vaccinated with the measles vaccine is important for promoting and preserving widespread immunity since the introduction of the measles vaccine measles has virtually been eliminated in the us even though not everyone has been vaccinated this effect is called herd immunity but herd immunity may now be weakening a bit likely due to a drop in vaccination rates the incidence of measles in the us recently increased significantly preventing a resurgence of measles steady vaccination rates are important because soon after vaccination rates decline measles begins to come back heres one example in 1998 a nowdiscredited study was published incorrectly linking autism to the measlesmumpsrubella mmr vaccine in the united kingdom where the study originated the rate of vaccination dropped to an alltime low of about 80 of all children in 2003 to 2004 in 2008 there were nearly 1400 labconfirmed cases of measles in england and wales no proven link between the mmr vaccine and autismafter the mmr study in 1998 some drops in vaccine numbers were found in the uk and elsewhere and some people believed there was a possible link since then widespread concerns have been raised about a possible link between the mmr vaccine and autism however extensive reports from the american academy of pediatrics the national academy of medicine and the cdc conclude that there is no scientifically proven link between the mmr vaccine and autism these organizations note that autism is often identified in toddlers between the ages of 18 and 30 months which is about the time children are given their first mmr vaccine but this coincidence in timing shouldnt be mistaken for a causeandeffect relationshipmore

rubella during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy develop congenital rubella syndrome this syndrome can cause one or more problems including growth delays cataracts deafness problems with the development of the heart congenital heart defects problems with the development of other organs problems with mental development and learning the highest risk to the fetus is during the first trimester but exposure later in pregnancy also is dangerous,the rubella vaccine is usually given as a combined measlesmumpsrubella mmr vaccine this vaccine may also include the chickenpox varicella vaccine mmrv vaccine health care providers recommend that children receive the mmr vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and again between 4 and 6 years of age before entering school the mmr vaccine prevents rubella and protects against it for life getting the vaccine can prevent rubella during future pregnancies babies born to women who have received the vaccine or who are already immune are usually protected from rubella for 6 to 8 months after birth if a child requires protection from rubella before 12 months of age for example for certain foreign travel the vaccine can be given as early as 6 months of age but children who are vaccinated early still need to be vaccinated at the recommended ages later providing the mmr vaccine as a combination of recommended vaccines can prevent delays in protection against measle mumps and rubella and with fewer shots the combination vaccine is as safe and effective as the vaccines given separately no proven link between the mmr vaccine and autismwidespread concerns have been raised about a possible link between the mmr vaccine and autism however extensive reports from the american academy of pediatrics the national academy of medicine and the centers for disease control and prevention conclude that there is no scientifically proven link between the mmr vaccine and autism these organizations note that autism is often identified in toddlers between the ages of 18 and 30 months which is about the time children are given their first mmr vaccine but this coincidence in timing shouldnt be mistaken for a causeandeffect relationship do you need the mmr vaccineyou dont need a vaccine if you had two doses of the mmr vaccine after 12 months of age have blood tests that show youre immune to measles mumps and rubella were born before 1957 people born before 1957 are likely to have had measles mumps and rubella during childhood and are immune however without a blood test that shows immunity the mmr vaccine is recommended get a vaccine if you have not had two doses of the mmr vaccine after age 12 months or a blood test to show that youre immune to measles mumps and rubella ensuring immunity is especially important if you are a nonpregnant woman of childbearing age attend college trade school or postsecondary school work in a hospital medical facility childcare center or school plan to travel overseas or take a cruise the vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women or women who plan to get pregnant within the next four weeks people who have had a lifethreatening allergic reaction to gelatin the antibiotic neomycin or a previous dose of mmr vaccine if you have cancer a blood disorder or another disease or you take medication that affects your immune system talk to your health care provider before getting an mmr vaccine side effects of the vaccinemost people experience no side effects from the vaccine for some people minor side effects may appear about two weeks after vaccination but usually occur less often after the second shot these can include sore arm at the injection site fever mild rash or redness at the injection site very few people experience temporary joint pain or stiffness especially in teens and adult women who werent previously immune to rubella swelling of the glands in the cheeks or neck seizures that occur with a fever low level of cells in the blood that help with clotting platelets

against cervical cancer and genital warts the centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends routine hpv vaccination for girls and boys ages 11 and 12 although it can be given as early as age 9 its ideal for girls and boys to receive the vaccine before they have sexual contact and are exposed to hpv research has shown that receiving the vaccine at a young age isnt linked to an earlier start of sexual activity once someone is infected with hpv the vaccine might not be as effective or might not work at all also response to the vaccine is better at younger ages than older ones but if given before someone is infected the vaccine can prevent most cases of cervical cancer the cdc recommends that all 11 and 12yearolds receive two doses of hpv vaccine at least six months apart younger adolescents ages 9 and 10 and teens ages 13 and 14 can also receive vaccination on the updated twodose schedule research has shown that the twodose schedule is effective for children under 15 teens and young adults who begin the vaccine series later at ages 15 through 26 should continue to receive three doses of the vaccine the cdc recommends catchup hpv vaccinations for all people through age 26 who arent adequately vaccinated the us food and drug administration recently approved the use of gardasil 9 for males and females ages 9 to 45 if youre age 27 to 45 discuss with your doctor whether

45,description,the signs and symptoms of ards can vary in intensity depending on its cause and severity as well as the presence of underlying heart or lung disease they include severe shortness of breath labored and unusually rapid breathing low blood pressure confusion and extreme tiredness when to see a doctorards usually follows a major illness or injury and most people who are affected are already hospitalized,bronchioles and alveoli enlarge image close bronchioles and alveoli bronchioles and alveoli your bronchioles are some of the smallest airways in your lungs inhaled air passes through tiny ducts from the bronchioles into elastic air sacs alveoli the alveoli are surrounded by the alveolarcapillary membrane which normally prevents liquid in the capillaries from entering the air sacs the mechanical cause of ards is fluid leaked from the smallest blood vessels in the lungs into the tiny air sacs where blood is oxygenated normally a protective membrane keeps this fluid in the vessels severe illness or injury however can cause damage to the membrane leading to the fluid leakage of ards underlying causes of ards include sepsis the most common cause of ards is sepsis a serious and widespread infection of the bloodstream inhalation of harmful substances breathing high concentrations of smoke or chemical fumes can result in ards as can inhaling aspirating vomit or neardrowning episodes severe pneumonia severe cases of pneumonia usually affect all five lobes of the lungs head chest or other major injury accidents such as falls or car crashes can directly damage the lungs or the portion of the brain that controls breathing coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 people who have severe covid19 may develop ards others pancreatitis inflammation of the pancreas massive blood transfusions and burns risk factorsmost people who develop ards are already hospitalized for another condition and many are critically ill youre especially at risk if you have a widespread infection in your bloodstream sepsis people who have a history of chronic alcoholism are at higher risk of developing ards theyre also more likely to die of ards,potential complications of acute kidney failure include fluid buildup acute kidney failure may lead to a buildup of fluid in your lungs which can cause shortness of breath chest pain if the lining that covers your heart pericardium becomes inflamed you may experience chest pain muscle weakness when your bodys fluids and electrolytes your bodys blood chemistry are out of balance muscle weakness can result permanent kidney damage occasionally acute kidney failure causes permanent loss of kidney function or endstage renal disease people with endstage renal disease require either permanent dialysis a mechanical filtration process used to remove toxins and wastes from the body or a kidney transplant to survive death acute kidney failure can lead to loss of kidney function and ultimately death,acute kidney failure is often difficult to predict or prevent but you may reduce your risk by taking care of your kidneys try to pay attention to labels when taking overthecounter otc pain medications follow the instructions for otc pain medications such as aspirin acetaminophen tylenol others ibuprofen advil motrin ib others and naproxen sodium aleve others taking too much of these medications may increase your risk of kidney injury this is especially true if you have preexisting kidney disease diabetes or high blood pressure work with your doctor to manage kidney and other chronic conditions if you have kidney disease or another condition that increases your risk of acute kidney failure such as diabetes or high blood pressure stay on track with treatment goals and follow your doctors recommendations to

46,description,alcohol poisoning symptoms include confusion vomiting seizures slow breathing which is fewer than eight breaths a minute breathing thats not regular this is when there is a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths skin that looks blue gray or pale low body temperature also known as hypothermia trouble staying conscious or awake when to see a doctorits not necessary to have all the above symptoms before seeking medical help a person with alcohol poisoning who has passed out or cant wake up could die alcohol poisoning is an emergencyif you think that someone has alcohol poisoning seek medical care right away this is true even if you dont see the usual signs heres what to do call 911 or your local emergency number right away never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning be prepared to give information if you know the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank and when tell hospital or emergency staff dont leave an unconscious person alone because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works someone with alcohol poisoning may vomit and choke and not be able to breathe while waiting for help dont try to make the person vomit because that could cause choking help someone who is vomiting try to keep the person sitting up if the person must lie down turn the head to the side to help prevent choking try to keep the person awake dont be afraid to get helpit can be hard to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to need medical help but its best to take action right away rather than be sorry later you may worry about what will happen to you or a friend or family member especially if underage but the results of not getting help in time can be far more serious,alcohol in the form of ethanol also called ethyl alcohol is in alcoholic beverages its also in mouthwash some cooking extracts some medicines and certain household products ethyl alcohol poisoning generally results from drinking too many alcoholic beverages in a short period of time other forms of alcohol can cause toxic poisoning that requires emergency treatment they include isopropyl alcohol which is found in rubbing alcohol lotions and some cleaning products methanol or ethylene glycol which is a common ingredient in antifreeze paints and solvents binge drinkinga major cause of alcohol poisoning is binge drinking this is when a male rapidly consumes five or more alcoholic drinks within two hours or a female consumes at least four drinks within two hours an alcohol binge can occur over hours or last up to several days a person can consume a fatal dose of alcohol before passing out even when the person is unconscious or stops drinking the stomach and intestines continue to release alcohol into the bloodstream and the level of alcohol in the body continues to rise how much is too muchunlike food which can take hours to digest the body absorbs alcohol quickly long before most other nutrients and it takes a lot more time for the body to get rid of alcohol most alcohol is processed by the liver the more you drink especially in a short period of time the greater your risk of alcohol poisoning heres what one drink means beer 12 fluid ounces 360 milliliters with about 5 alcohol malt liquor 8 to 9 fluid ounces 240 to 270 milliliters with about 7 alcohol wine 5 fluid ounces 150 milliliters with about 12 alcohol liquor such as gin rum vodka or whiskey 15 fluid ounces 45 milliliters of an 80proof drink which has about 40 alcohol but the amount of alcohol in one drink may be much higher than those in the list above for example some craft beers may have four times the amount of alcohol thats in a regular beer alcohol content is displayed on the label or you can ask the server about alcohol content be aware of the alcohol content of what youre drinking and adjust how much you drink based on this knowledge mixed drinks may contain more than one serving of alcohol risk factorsseveral factors can increase your risk of alcohol poisoning including your height and weight health conditions that affect how your body processes alcohol whether youve eaten recently whether youve had alcohol along with other drugs including medicines you take for health reasons the percentage of alcohol in your drinks how fast and how much alcohol you drink how your body processes alcohol,severe complications can result from alcohol poisoning including choking alcohol may cause vomiting because it depresses the gag reflex this increases the risk of choking on vomit if a person passes out stopping breathing accidentally inhaling vomit into the lungs can lead to a dangerous or fatal interruption of breathing also known as asphyxiation severe loss of fluids vomiting can result in severe dehydration which happens when the body doesnt have enough water and other fluids this can lead to dangerously low blood pressure and a fast heart rate seizures the blood sugar level may drop low enough to cause seizures hypothermia the body temperature may drop so low that it leads to cardiac arrest unusual heartbeat alcohol poisoning can cause a heartbeat that is not regular it can even cause the heart to stop brain damage heavy drinking may cause brain damage that cant be reversed death any of the issues above can lead to death,to avoid alcohol poisoning drink alcohol in moderation if at all if you choose to drink alcohol do so in moderation for healthy adults that means up to two drinks a day for males and one drink a day for females when you drink enjoy your drink slowly dont drink alcohol along with certain medicines some medicines can cause harmful effects when taken with even small amounts of alcohol and certain health conditions may mean it takes less alcohol than expected to reach the level of alcohol poisoning ask your health care provider if these risks apply to you dont drink on an empty stomach having some food in your stomach may slow the process of absorbing alcohol somewhat but it wont prevent alcohol poisoning during binge drinking communicate with your teens talk to your teenagers about the dangers of alcohol including binge drinking evidence suggests that children who are warned about alcohol by their parents and who report close relationships with their parents are less likely to start drinking store products safely if you have small children store alcoholcontaining products including cosmetics mouthwashes and medicines out of their reach use childproof bathroom and kitchen cabinets to prevent access to household cleaners keep toxic items in your garage or storage area safely out of reach consider keeping alcoholic beverages under lock and key get followup care ask about followup care for alcohol poisoning meeting with a health care provider particularly an

such as numbers doing more than one task at once is especially difficult it may be challenging to manage finances balance checkbooks and pay bills on time eventually a person with alzheimers disease may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers making judgments and decisionsalzheimers disease causes a decline in the ability to make sensible decisions and judgments in everyday situations for example a person may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather it may become harder for someone to respond to everyday problems for example the person may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or decisions when driving planning and performing familiar tasksroutine activities that require completing steps in order become a struggle this may include planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game eventually people with advanced alzheimers disease forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing changes in personality and behaviorbrain changes that occur in alzheimers disease can affect moods and behaviors problems may include the following depression loss of interest in activities social withdrawal mood swings distrust in others anger or aggression changes in sleeping habits wandering loss of inhibitions delusions such as believing something has been stolen preserved skillsdespite major changes to memory and skills people with alzheimers disease are able to hold on to some skills even as symptoms get worse preserved skills may include reading or listening to books telling stories sharing memories singing listening to music dancing drawing or doing crafts these skills may be preserved longer because theyre controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease when to see a doctora number of conditions can result in memory loss or other dementia symptoms some of those conditions can be treated if you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills talk to your

disease enlarge image close healthy brain and brain with alzheimers disease healthy brain and brain with alzheimers disease in the brain of someone with alzheimers disease amyloid plaques form and tau proteins change shape and become tangles the exact causes of alzheimers disease arent fully understood but at a basic level brain proteins fail to function as usual this disrupts the work of brain cells also called neurons and triggers a series of events the neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other they eventually die scientists believe that for most people alzheimers disease is caused by a combination of genetic lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time in less than 1 of cases alzheimers is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease in these cases the disease usually begins in middle age the development of the disease begins years before the first symptoms the damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory the loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brain by the late stage of the disease the brain has shrunk significantly researchers trying to understand the cause of alzheimers disease are focused on the role of two proteins plaques betaamyloid is a fragment of a larger protein when these fragments clump together they appear to have a toxic effect on neurons and to disrupt communication between brain cells these clumps form larger deposits called amyloid plaques which also include other cellular debris tangles tau proteins play a part in a brain cells internal support and transport system to carry nutrients and other essential materials in alzheimers disease tau proteins change shape and organize into structures called neurofibrillary tangles the tangles disrupt the transport system and cause damage to cells more informationalzheimers disease care at mayo clinicmayo clinic minute women and alzheimers disease risk factorsageincreasing age is the greatest known risk factor for alzheimers disease alzheimers isnt a part of typical aging but as you grow older the chances of developing it increases one study found that every year there were four new diagnoses per 1000 people ages 65 to 74 among people ages 75 to 84 there were 32 new diagnoses per 1000 people for those 85 and older there were 76 new diagnoses per 1000 people family history and geneticsthe risk of developing alzheimers is somewhat higher if a firstdegree relative your parent or sibling has the disease just how genes among families affect the risk is largely unexplained and the genetic factors are likely complex a better understood genetic factor is a form of the apolipoprotein e apoe gene a form of the gene apoe e4 increases the risk of alzheimers disease about 25 to 30 of the population carries an apoe e4 allele but not everyone with this form of the gene develops the disease scientists have found rare changes in three genes that virtually guarantee a person who inherits one of them will develop alzheimers but these changes account for less than 1 of people with alzheimers disease down syndromemany people with down syndrome develop alzheimers disease this is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 21 chromosome 21 is the gene involved in the production of the protein that leads to the creation of betaamyloid betaamyloid fragments can become plaques in the brain symptoms tend to appear 10 to 20 years earlier in people with down syndrome than they do for the general population sexoverall there are more women with the disease because they tend to live longer than men mild cognitive impairmentsomeone with mild cognitive impairment mci has a decline in memory or other thinking skills that is greater than usual for the persons age but the decline doesnt prevent the person from functioning in social or work environments however people with mci have a significant risk of developing dementia when mci affects mainly memory the condition is more likely to progress to dementia due to alzheimers disease a diagnosis of mci offers people the chance to put a greater focus on healthy lifestyle changes and to come up with strategies to make up for memory loss they also can schedule regular health care appointments to monitor symptoms head traumaseveral large studies found that people age 50 years or older who had a traumatic brain injury tbi had an increased risk of dementia and alzheimers disease the risk is even higher in people with moresevere and multiple tbis some studies found that the risk may be greatest within the first six months to two years after the injury air pollutionstudies in animals have found that air pollution particulates can speed the breakdown of the nervous system and human studies have found that air pollution exposure especially from traffic exhaust and burning wood is linked to a greater dementia risk excessive alcohol consumptiondrinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes several large studies and reviews found that alcohol use disorders were linked to an increased risk of dementia earlyonset dementia in particular poor sleep patternsresearch has shown that poor sleep patterns such as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep are linked to an increased risk of alzheimers disease lifestyle and heart healthresearch has shown that the same risk factors associated with heart disease also may increase the risk of dementia its unclear if these factors increase risk of dementia by worsening alzheimers changes in the brain or by leading to brain vascular changes they include lack of exercise obesity smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke high blood pressure high cholesterol poorly controlled type 2 diabetes these factors can all be modified therefore changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk for example regular exercise and a healthy lowfat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are related to a lower risk of alzheimers disease lifelong learning and social engagementstudies have found that socializing and engaging in activities that stimulate the mind throughout life can lower the risk of alzheimers disease low education levels less than a high school education appear to be a risk factor for alzheimers disease complicationsalzheimers symptoms such as memory loss language loss impaired judgment and other brain changes can make it harder to manage other health conditions a person with alzheimers disease may not be able to tell someone about being in pain explain symptoms of another illness follow a treatment plan explain medicine side effects as alzheimers disease moves into its last stages brain changes begin to affect physical functions the changes can affect the ability to swallow balance and control bowel and bladder movements these effects can lead to other health problems such as inhaling food or liquid into the lungs flu pneumonia and other infections falls fractures bedsores poor nutrition or dehydration constipation or diarrhea dental problems such as mouth sores or tooth decay,alzheimers disease is not a preventable condition however a number of lifestyle risk factors can be modified evidence suggests that taking steps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease may also lower your risk of developing dementia to follow hearthealthy lifestyle choices that may reduce the risk of dementia exercise regularly eat a diet of fresh produce healthy oils and foods low in saturated fat such as a mediterranean diet follow treatment guidelines to manage high blood pressure diabetes and high cholesterol if you smoke ask your health care provider for help to quit one large longterm study done in finland found that making lifestyle changes helped reduce cognitive decline among people who were at risk of dementia those in the study were given individual and group sessions that focused on diet exercise and social activities in another study done in australia people at risk of dementia were given coaching sessions on diet exercise and other lifestyle changes they had better results on cognitive tests after one two and three years compared to people who didnt receive the coaching other studies have shown that staying engaged mentally and socially is linked to preserved thinking skills later in life and a lower risk of alzheimers disease this includes going to social events reading dancing playing board games creating art playing an instrument and other activitiesmore informationalzheimers disease care

48,description,anemia symptoms depend on the cause and how bad the anemia is anemia can be so mild that it,no symptoms at first but symptoms usually then occur and get worse as the anemia gets worse if another disease causes the anemia the disease can mask the anemia symptoms then a test for another condition might find the anemia certain types of anemia have symptoms that point to the cause possible symptoms of anemia include tiredness weakness shortness of breath pale or yellowish skin which might be more obvious on white skin than on black or brown skin irregular heartbeat dizziness or lightheadedness chest pain cold hands and feet headaches when to see a doctormake an appointment with your health care provider if youre tired or short of breath and dont know why low levels of the protein in red blood cells that carry oxygen called hemoglobin is the main sign of anemia some people learn they have low hemoglobin when they donate blood if youre told that you cant donate because of low hemoglobin make a medical appointment  causesanemia occurs when the blood doesnt have enough hemoglobin or red blood cells this can happen if the body doesnt make enough hemoglobin or red blood cells bleeding causes loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin faster than they can be replaced the body destroys red blood cells and the hemoglobin thats in them what red blood cells dothe body makes three types of blood cells white blood cells fight infection platelets help blood clot and red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body red blood cells have an ironrich protein that gives blood its red color called hemoglobin hemoglobin lets red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body and it lets red blood cells carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to the lungs to be breathed out spongy matter inside many of the large bones called bone marrow makes red blood cells and hemoglobin to make them the body needs iron vitamin b12 folate and other nutrients from foods causes of anemiadifferent types of anemia have different causes they include iron deficiency anemia too little iron in the body causes this most common type of anemia bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin without enough iron the body cant make enough hemoglobin for red blood cells pregnant people can get this type of anemia if they dont take iron supplements blood loss also can cause it blood loss might be from heavy menstrual bleeding an ulcer cancer or regular use of some pain relievers especially aspirin vitamin deficiency anemia besides iron the body needs folate and vitamin b12 to make enough healthy red blood cells a diet that doesnt have enough of these and other key nutrients can result in the body not making enough red blood cells also some people cant absorb vitamin b12 this can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia also called pernicious anemia anemia of inflammation diseases that cause ongoing inflammation can keep the body from making enough red blood cells examples are cancer hivaids rheumatoid arthritis kidney disease and crohns disease aplastic anemia this rare lifethreatening anemia occurs when the body doesnt make enough new blood cells causes of aplastic anemia include infections certain medicines autoimmune diseases and being in contact with toxic chemicals anemias linked to bone marrow disease diseases such as leukemia and myelofibrosis can affect how the bone marrow makes blood the effects of these types of diseases range from mild to lifethreatening hemolytic anemias this group of anemias is from red blood cells being destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them certain blood diseases increase how fast red blood cells are destroyed some types of hemolytic anemia can be passed through families which is called inherited sickle cell anemia this inherited and sometimes serious condition is a type of hemolytic anemia an unusual hemoglobin forces red blood cells into an unusual crescent shape called a sickle these irregular blood cells die too soon that causes an ongoing shortage of red blood cells risk factorsthese factors can increase risk of anemia a diet that doesnt have enough of certain vitamins and minerals not getting enough iron vitamin b12 and folate increases the risk of anemia problems with the small intestine having a condition that affects how the small intestine takes in nutrients increases the risk of anemia examples are crohns disease and celiac disease menstrual periods in general having heavy periods can create a risk of anemia having periods causes the loss of red blood cells pregnancy pregnant people who dont take a multivitamin with folic acid and iron are at an increased risk of anemia ongoing called chronic conditions having cancer kidney failure diabetes or another chronic condition increases the risk of anemia of chronic disease these conditions can lead to having too few red blood cells slow chronic blood loss from an ulcer or other source within the body can use up the bodys store of iron leading to iron deficiency anemia family history having a family member with a type of anemia passed through families called inherited can increase the risk of inherited anemias such as sickle cell anemia other factors a history of certain infections blood diseases and autoimmune conditions increases the risk of anemia drinking too much alcohol being around toxic chemicals and taking some medicines can affect the making of red blood cells and lead to anemia age people over age 65 are at increased risk of anemia,if not treated anemia can cause many health problems such as severe tiredness severe anemia can make it impossible to do everyday tasks pregnancy complications pregnant people with folate deficiency anemia may be more likely to have complications such as premature birth heart problems anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia with anemia the heart must pump more blood to make up for too little oxygen in the blood this can lead to an enlarged heart or heart failure death some inherited anemias such as sickle cell anemia can lead to lifethreatening complications losing a lot of blood quickly causes severe anemia and can be fatal,many types of anemia cant be prevented but eating a healthy diet might prevent iron deficiency anemia and vitamin deficiency anemias a healthy diet includes iron ironrich foods include beef and other meats beans lentils ironfortified cereals dark green leafy vegetables and dried fruit folate this nutrient and its humanmade form folic acid can be found in fruits and fruit juices dark green leafy vegetables green peas kidney beans peanuts and enriched grain products such as bread cereal pasta and rice vitamin b12 foods rich in vitamin b12 include meat dairy products and fortified cereals and soy products vitamin c foods rich in vitamin c include citrus fruits and juices peppers broccoli tomatoes melons and strawberries these also help the body take in iron if youre concerned about getting enough vitamins and minerals from food ask your health care provider about taking a multivitamin by mayo clinic staff anemia care at mayo clinic request an

oil sebaceous glands hair follicles are connected to oil glands the follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead or the plug may be open to the surface and darken causing a blackhead a blackhead

in a blood vessel in the brain an aneurysm often looks like a berry hanging on a stem experts think brain aneurysms form and grow because blood flowing through the blood vessel puts pressure on a weak area of the vessel wall this can increase the size of the brain aneurysm if the brain aneurysm leaks or ruptures it,bleeding in the brain known as a hemorrhagic stroke most often a ruptured brain

aneurysm is a medical emergency that can cause lifethreatening bleeding in the brain dr bendok the typical presentation is somebody who has the worst headache of their life vivien williams fast treatment is essential it includes open surgery or lessinvasive options such as sealing the ruptured artery from within the blood vessel with metal coils andor stents dr bendok says 1 to 2 percent of the population have aneurysms and only a small percentage of that group will experience a rupture people who have a family history of aneurysms have polycystic kidney disease connective tissue disease and people who smoke are at increased risk of rupture and should consider screening if a rupture happens fast treatment can save lives for the mayo clinic news network im vivien williams  causesbrain aneurysms are caused by thinning artery walls aneurysms often form at forks or branches in arteries because those areas of the vessels are weaker although aneurysms can appear anywhere in the brain theyre most common in arteries at the base of the brain risk factorsseveral factors can contribute to weakness in an artery wall these factors may increase the risk of a brain aneurysm or aneurysm rupture some of these risk factors develop over time but some conditions present at birth can increase the risk of developing a brain aneurysm risk factors include older age brain aneurysms can occur at any age however theyre more common in adults between ages 30 and 60 being female brain aneurysms are more common in women than in men cigarette smoking smoking is a risk factor for brain aneurysms to form and for brain aneurysms to rupture high blood pressure this condition can weaken arteries aneurysms are more likely to form and to rupture in weakened arteries drug use particularly using cocaine drug use raises blood pressure if illicit drugs are used intravenously it can lead to an infection an infection can cause a mycotic aneurysm heavy alcohol use this also can increase blood pressure inherited connective tissue disorders such as ehlersdanlos syndrome these disorders weaken blood vessels polycystic kidney disease this inherited disorder results in fluidfilled sacs in the kidneys it also may increase blood pressure a narrow aorta known as coarctation of the aorta the aorta is the large blood vessel that delivers oxygenrich blood from the heart to the body brain arteriovenous malformation known as avm in this condition arteries and veins in the brain are tangled this affects blood flow a family history of brain aneurysm your risk is higher if you have family members who have had a brain aneurysm this is particularly true if two or more firstdegree relatives such as a parent brother sister or child has had a brain aneurysm if you have a family history you can ask your health care provider about getting screened for a brain aneurysm some types of aneurysms may occur after a head injury or from certain blood infections risk factors for a ruptured aneurysmthere are some factors that make it more likely an aneurysm will rupture they include having a large aneurysm having aneurysms in certain locations smoking cigarettes having untreated high blood pressure,when a brain aneurysm ruptures the bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds however the blood can cause direct damage to surrounding cells and can kill brain cells it also increases pressure inside the skull if the pressure becomes too high it may disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain loss of consciousness or even death may occur complications that can develop after the rupture of an aneurysm include rebleeding an aneurysm that has ruptured or has leaked is at risk of bleeding again rebleeding can cause further damage to brain cells narrowed blood vessels in the brain after a brain aneurysm ruptures blood vessels in the brain may contract and narrow this is known as vasospasm vasospasm can cause an ischemic stroke in which theres limited blood flow to brain cells this may cause additional cell damage and loss a buildup of fluid within the brain known as hydrocephalus most often a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain the blood can block the movement of fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord as a result an excess of fluid puts pressure on the brain and can damage tissues change in sodium level bleeding in the brain can disrupt the balance of sodium in the blood this may occur from damage to the hypothalamus an area near the base of the brain a drop in blood sodium levels can lead to swelling of brain cells and permanent damage,in many cases brain aneurysms cant be prevented but there are some changes you can make to lower your risk they include quitting smoking if you smoke also work with your health care provider to lower your blood pressure if its high dont drink large amounts of alcohol or use drugs such as cocaine by mayo clinic staff brain aneurysm care at

more within a few days such changes could mean that existing heart failure is getting worse or that treatment isnt workingmore informationheart failure care at mayo cliniccardiac asthma what causes it  causes chambers and valves of the heart enlarge image close chambers and valves of the heart chambers and valves of the heart a typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers the upper chambers the right and left atria receive incoming blood the lower chambers the more muscular right and left ventricles pump blood out of the heart the heart valves which keep blood flowing in the right direction are gates at the chamber openings enlarged heart in heart failure enlarge image close enlarged heart in heart failure enlarged heart in heart failure if the heart weakens as it can with heart failure it begins to enlarge this forces the heart to work harder to pump blood to the rest of the body heart failure can be caused by a weakened damaged or stiff heart if the heart is damaged or weakened the heart chambers may stretch and get bigger the heart cant pump out the needed amount of blood if the main pumping chambers of the heart called the ventricles are stiff they cant fill with enough blood between beats the heart muscle can be damaged by certain infections heavy alcohol use illegal drug use and some chemotherapy medicines your genes also can play a role any of the following conditions also can damage or weaken the heart and cause heart failure coronary artery disease and heart attack coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure the disease results from the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries the deposits narrow the arteries this reduces blood flow and can lead to heart attack a heart attack occurs suddenly when an artery feeding the heart becomes completely blocked damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean that the heart can no longer pump as well as it should high blood pressure also called hypertension this condition forces the heart to work harder than it should to pump blood through the body over time the extra work can make the heart muscle too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood heart valve disease the valves of the heart keep blood flowing the right way if a valve isnt working properly the heart must work harder to pump blood this can weaken the heart over time treating some types of heart valve problems may reverse heart failure inflammation of the heart muscle also called myocarditis myocarditis is most commonly caused by a virus including the covid19 virus and can lead to leftsided heart failure a heart problem that youre born with also called a congenital heart defect if the heart and its chambers or valves havent formed correctly the other parts of the heart have to work harder to pump blood this may lead to heart failure irregular heart rhythms called arrhythmias irregular heart rhythms may cause the heart to beat too fast creating extra work for the heart a slow heartbeat also may lead to heart failure treating an irregular heart rhythm may reverse heart failure in some people other diseases some longterm diseases may contribute to chronic heart failure examples are diabetes hiv infection an overactive or underactive thyroid or a buildup of iron or protein causes of sudden heart failure also include allergic reactions any illness that affects the whole body blood clots in the lungs severe infections use of certain medicines viruses that attack the heart muscle heart failure usually begins with the lower left heart chamber called the left ventricle this is the hearts main pumping chamber but heart failure also can affect the right side the lower right heart chamber is called the right ventricle sometimes heart failure affects both sides of the heart type of heart failure description source american heart association rightsided heart failure this type affects the lower right heart chamber called the right ventricle fluid may back up into the belly legs and feet causing swelling leftsided heart failure this type affects the lower left heart chamber called the left ventricle fluid may back up in the lungs causing shortness of breath heart failure with reduced ejection fraction hfref also called systolic heart failure this is a type of leftsided heart failure the left ventricle cant squeeze as strong as it should the heart isnt strong enough to pump enough blood to the body heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfpef also called diastolic heart failure this is a type of leftsided heart failure the left ventricle cant relax or fill fully the heart has a problem filling with blood risk factorsdiseases and conditions that increase the risk of heart failure include coronary artery disease narrowed arteries may limit the hearts supply of oxygenrich blood resulting in weakened heart muscle heart attack a heart attack is a form of coronary artery disease that occurs suddenly damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean the heart can no longer pump as well as it should heart valve disease having a heart valve that doesnt work properly raises the risk of heart failure high blood pressure the heart works harder than it has to when blood pressure is high irregular heartbeats irregular heartbeats especially if they are very frequent and fast can weaken the heart muscle and cause heart failure congenital heart disease some people who develop heart failure were born with problems that affect the structure or function of their heart diabetes having diabetes increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease sleep apnea this inability to breathe properly during sleep results in low bloodoxygen levels and an increased risk of irregular heartbeats both of these problems can weaken the heart obesity people who have obesity have a higher risk of developing heart failure viral infections some viral infections can damage to the heart muscle medicines that may increase the risk of heart failure include some diabetes medicines the diabetes drugs rosiglitazone avandia and pioglitazone actos have been found to increase the risk of heart failure in some people dont stop taking these medicines without first talking to your health care provider some other medicines other medicines that may lead to heart failure or heart problems include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids and some medicines used to treat high blood pressure cancer blood conditions irregular heartbeats nervous system diseases mental health conditions lung and urinary problems and infections other risk factors for heart failure include aging the hearts ability to work decreases with age even in healthy people alcohol use drinking too much alcohol may weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure smoking or using tobacco if you smoke quit using tobacco increases the risk of heart disease and heart failure,if you have health failure its important to have regular health checkups even if symptoms improve your health care provider can examine you and run tests to check for complications complications of heart failure depend on your age overall health and the severity of heart disease they may include kidney damage or failure heart failure can reduce the blood flow to the kidneys untreated this can cause kidney failure kidney damage from heart failure can require dialysis for treatment other heart problems heart failure can cause changes in the hearts size and function these changes may damage heart valves and cause irregular heartbeats liver damage heart failure can cause fluid buildup that puts too much pressure on the liver this fluid backup can lead to scarring which makes it more difficult for the liver to work properly sudden cardiac death if the heart is weak there is a risk of dying suddenly due to a dangerous irregular heart rhythm,one way to prevent heart failure is to treat and control the conditions that can cause it these conditions include coronary artery disease high blood pressure diabetes and obesity some of the same lifestyle changes used to manage heart failure also may help prevent it try these hearthealthy tips
